          Even though your birthday this year might be accompanied by sadness
          and occasional tears, I still want you to find moments of joy and wear
          smiles on your face. Be extremely happy and keep smiling. Remember, I
          will always be there to support you, no matter what you find or face.
          You can count on me.
